questions to ask.
"how long have you been in business"
"items for sale (stock list)"
"promotional offers?"
"how many staff do you have"
"what made you want to open this kind of business?"
"do you have any future plans for this business?"
"any personal message you want to communicate to your customers/potential customers?"
"would you be interested in us setting up a news bulletin board?"

i will arrange a meeting with Jillian either today or tomorrow and see if 
she can answer a few of these questions.
i think this data will be relevant for the home/about page on the website.
